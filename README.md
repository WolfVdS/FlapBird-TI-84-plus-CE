# FlapBird-TI-84-plus-CE
FlapBird is a FlappyBird-type game made from scratch for the TI-84 plus CE calculator using the CE development toolchain.
I made this project when i was 16 years old as my first c++ project, but I have updated a little since.

# Gameplay

FlapBird jumps up using the up-arrow key. To try again after hitting a pipe, use the 2nd key. To stop the game, simply press he del key.
